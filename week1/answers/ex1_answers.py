The New Town Vault was more likely to cause a wrong answer. It is almost correct, as it can fit 160 guests and is available, but does not have vegan options. Also it has a similar name to the correct answer, The Haymarket Vaults, which could confuse the model.

The google/gemma-2-2b-it model was used for this task. Plain, XML, and Sandwich all correctly answered the question.

CORE_LESSON = """
Context formatting matters for all prompts, so the manner of presentation is as important as the information itself. The distractors did not change the quality of results both in the bigger and smaller model, which means the task was not very difficult for the models to solve.
