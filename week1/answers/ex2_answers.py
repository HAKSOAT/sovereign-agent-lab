# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".

# In placeholder mode this will be a placehold.co URL.
# In live mode it will be a provider CDN URL.

TASK_B_PROMPT_USED = "Professional event flyer for Edinburgh AI Meetup, tech professionals, modern venue at The Albanach, Edinburgh. 160 guests tonight. Warm lighting, Scottish architecture background, clean modern typography."

# Why did the agent's behaviour NOT change when Nebius removed FLUX?
# One sentence. This is the point of the lesson.
TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = """
The agent's behaviour did not change when Nebius removed FLUX because the agent was using the placeholder mode. The placeholder mode returns a deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder", which is a valid result. The agent was able to continue with the task without the need to change its behaviour.

The Albanach has a capacity of 180, which is too small. The Haymarket Vaults can only hold 160, also too small. The Guilford Arms has 200 capacity but doesn't offer vegan options. The Bow Bar can only take 80 people and is already ful...

TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
The LangGraph graph is more flexible than the Rasa graph. The LangGraph graph has one loop node, where the model decides what to do at every step. The Rasa graph has multiple flows, where the LLM only decides WHICH flow to start. The LangGraph graph is more flexible because it can handle unexpected requests by changing the flow at runtime. The Rasa graph is more explicit because it has to be defined in advance.
